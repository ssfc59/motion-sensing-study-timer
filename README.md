# motion sensing study timer

This study timer follows the Pomodoro technique, with a 25 minute work portion followed by a 5 minute break portion. The Neopixel stick on the top provides a basic visual representation of the amount of time elapsed, while the LCD screen displays the time elapsed in an analog format. This timing format creates a study routine to keep the user on track, while the PIR sensor tracks oneâ€™s patterns of movement as they study: if the user is in motion, aka typing, writing, or sketching something, it is more likely that they are at work. In constrast, if the user is not moving, they are more likely to not be at work. Following that logic, whenever the PIR sensor does not detect any motion, the LCD screen will display a random encouraging message out of 10 to motivate the user to continue working. With these functionalities, this study timer can foster more productive and enjoyable study sessions.
